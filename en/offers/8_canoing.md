# Describtion of the activity 

Make the decision to take part in a canoing tour on the Presa, which is full of adventure and a lot of funny watergames to let you have an unforgettable day. The activity starts at 9:00 am in front of the youth hostel. We are going by bus straight to the Presa. After a few instructions you start the activity. It doesn`t matter, if you are on a normal three-seater or on the big boat – we guarantee you a lot of fun! When you will have finished the strenuous sport activity, you have enough spare time to have a barbecue, to go swimming, to relax or to go for a walk before returning by bus to Vallehermoso at about 20:00 pm.
