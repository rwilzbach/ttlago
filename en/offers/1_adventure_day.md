# Enjoy an unforgettable day in and around the little village Alojera! You aren´t sure? Here is our proposal for a day tour.

Our bus picks you up at the Town Hall Square at 08:30. During the bus ride you can delight in the impressing scenery of the northern part of La Gomera. We will stop at some wonderful viewpoints to have a look at the island of La Palma. After this we will go hiking with a local guide, who also speaks English, from Chorros de Epina to Alojera. During the hiking tour we get to a natural source, from which you can drink fresh and cool water without any health risks. You can experience the whole flora and fauna of the little island as well.

From the hill top you can see through beautiful forests and enjoy the unique view of the sea or have a look at the wonderful palmtrees. If you sit down near a cliff, close your eyes und simply listen to the waves.

After lunch in Alojera, the adventure-based programme starts. This includes a communication-game, clay stamping and do pottery. Then you can walk over to the palmtree-museum, where the visitor gets valuable information of the "palmas”. After that you can descend to the beach and end the day watching the wonderful sunset, have a picnic or go to a restaurant. In this bay you can even go swimming if you love hight waves. The bus back to Vallehermoso will pick you up at 7 pm, but you can choose the hour.

That is the day to experience the active side of La Gomera and enjoy the scenery. This day is also perfect for nature-loving people.

## ADVICE: 

We are required to divide groups with more than 30 persons into two teams, because the adventure-based programme has a limited number of participants. Furthermore you can book this day in reverse order.
