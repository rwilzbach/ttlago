After we will have picked you up in the municipality of Vallehermoso at 8:00 am, our bus will take you to the Garajonay National Park, in the middle of the island. On the way there we will repeatedly give you the opportunity to take pictures of the beauty and vastness of the island.

A small footpath will lead you into the only remaining European laurel forest. You will be accompanied by experienced rangers from the National Park. On the way we through the forest, you will often stop to do group games and get information on many interesting things about the particular evergreen forest. Every now and then you will get a breathtaking view over the forest, of the Teide, an extinct volcano on the neighboring island of Tenerife. In the middle of the forest there is a chapel (Ermita de Lourdes) where you will have you packed lunch. Then you will follow a little stream through the "Laurisilva". Enjoy the tranquility and listen to the explanations why there is a stream in the Garajonay although it hardly ever rains. The reason is the fog, which is retained by mossy trees; therefore, the droplets seep into the ground, forming small streams.

After some time, you will reach the edge of the forest. There you will experience the climax; you can walk blindfold through a dark tunnel of about 400 meters long, which is so low that you can hardly walk upright. Inside the tunnel you need to wear sandals or flip flops, because the tunnel is partially flooded. The bus will wait for you at the end of a path about 10 minutes away from the tunnel. The trip back to the hostel will take about half an hour, and you will be home by four o'clock.
