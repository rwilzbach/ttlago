# A wunderful day in San Sebastian

We pick you up at 8:00 am at the town hall square to invite you to a wonderful day in San Sebastian. During the 45-minute trip you can enjoy the view over the beautiful landscape of the Spanish island. On request, it could be allowed doing some short stops so you can take some pictures or admire the view, for example, of the island of La Palma. Once in San Sebastian you will have to walk a few minutes to the port. There will be assisstants expecting you to help you with the life vests and give you some instruction on how you behave during the water adventures. After that, the fun begins!
