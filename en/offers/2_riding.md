# Horse Riding

At 8 am after breakfast we will pick you up at the Town Hall Square. During the one hour drive to the horse ranch in San Sebastián you will have a beautiful view of the mountains and the lonely villages of La Gomera. The bus stops next to the horse stable. At first you get a short instruction how to look after the horses and how to clean them. Then you have the possibility of getting the horses ready for the riding lessons. After each group has saddled the horse, the group will lead its horse over to the riding court.

For the beginners there are also riding instructors to help. For security reasons you can lend helmets for free. After several rounds the horses are cleaned again and taken back into the horse stable.

In the riding breaks you can do lots of activities at a little playground and football field. After eating your own packed lunch you have the possibility of walking to the town center of San Sebastián and take part in a cooking lesson or a sport activity offered by us. These offers are free to be combined. So there are also alternative things to do. You can spend the day on the beach, go shopping or visit the city on your own. At 6 pm the bus will take you back to the Town Hall Square of Vallehermoso. From this place you get back to the youth hostel in a five minutes.
