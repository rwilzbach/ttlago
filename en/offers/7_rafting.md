In fact: Raft building in the surrounded by mountains lake Presa. We will pick you up at 9 o clock in Vallehermoso. The travel time is only clear 10 minutes where you can see the small streets of the Island. Further there is the possibility to hike from the village square to the lake. Then the group will learn to know some exciting plays in which the whole group is involved. These will be explaind by our group leaders, who are all talk in three languages (english, spanish and german). Then the introduction into the science at building raft is taken. Now itÂ´s your turn. You have to build swim able rafts in little groups, just with help of very simply materials. Those are boards, beams, ropes and air tanks.

The entertaining activity, building rafts shows to you all to work in common for a goal, surrounded by the beautiful mountain landscape. The national park is called Garajonay. As soon you have finished the construction of your rafts the next fun starts. The maiden voyage will be held after the rafts get their official launch.

"Ship ahoy" now the captain will say and the journey starts. After the rafts are safe on the lake and the crew paddles, we have great games for you.  One of these is to collect little funny plastic ducks or you can swim in the lake.

Probably you get a little bit hungry on the interesting and tiring trip. Then you can find an unbelievable lovely place, where you can make barbecue (existing asphalted place). Further you could hike around the presa or swim, before the way back to Vallerhermoso starts.
