# Cliff walk

As another activity we offer a beautiful cliff walk from Arure to Valle Gran Rey. You have a daily connection to the starting point of the hiking tour in Arure at 8:00 am with a bus provided by us from the hostel in Vallehermoso. We stop at a viewpoint with a stunning view over the neighboring islands of La Gomera. You start the 2-hour walk in Arure at a platform with beautiful views of La Palma. Then follow the signs to Valle Gran Rey along the coast line.

Here it is useful to take a little break and enjoy the view. This is followed by a relatively strenuous 50-minute descent to Valle Gran Rey, where you will be rewarded by the beautiful scenery. Once at the bottom, you will reach the beach in a few minutes. There you have a variety of activities such as swimming, get souvenirs and walk to the harbour. You can also join a Whale-Whatching tour, one of our other attractions. Of course, the way back to our hostel is included. You will be picked up by our bus at 6.00 pm at the harbour in Valle Gran Rey.
