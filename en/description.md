It is a great opportunity for young people to experience the fascinating landscape of La Gomera. Different sport grounds are in the immediate vicinity of the hostel. Furthermore a number of Restaurants offer a great variety of local food. There are three shops in Vallehermoso, too. Don't miss the experience of beautiful sunsets.
